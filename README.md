# SpotiApp

This project was developed in Angular. It is a webpage that uses the Spotify API to display the latest releases, artists and the top tracks of an specific artist.

I am using different items of Angular for example:
+ Components
+ Services
+ Pipes
+ Custom routes

## Screenshots

Home page: displays the latest releases
![](path/new_releases.png?raw=true)

Search page: allow the user to search artists
![](path/search.png?raw=true)

Artist page: displays information about an artist
![](path/artist.png?raw=true)

Error page: is displayed when an error occurs
![](path/error.png?raw=true)

**Note: It is important to mention that if you want to test it you should get an access token from spotify, I am not sharing my token because it is private information**
